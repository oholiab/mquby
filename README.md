MQuby - ActiveMQ JRuby DSL
==========================

What?
-----
This is a DSL implimented in JRuby to interface with the ActiveMQ Java libraries
because I hate screwing about with XML configs. Very much a proof-of-concept
with a minimal feature set.

Why?
----
Because XML makes me want to claw my own eyes out.

Quirks
------
Some of the jar files that are automagically loaded might not be right on your
system. This is very much a YMMV kind of project. Feel free to try and build and
expand on it.

Requirements
------------
Probably some ruby junk, whichever java that ActiveMQ runs on and a copy of
ActiveMQ of some version probably. I'm sorry I don't remember more about when I
wrote this.

Pull requests, corrections, errata, extra information in the README are all
welcome, so please don't hesitate.
