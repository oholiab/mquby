activemq.rb
===========
This script was written by [R.I.Pienaar](http://github.com/ripienaar) as a proof
of concept of the original idea for this project. Whilst the rest of the project
is my implementation of his idea, everything in this directory is actually his
code which I've left here as an example and reference for when I'm working on
the project.

As such, this directory should remain either *unmodified* in any forks or
*deleted*. It's up to you.
